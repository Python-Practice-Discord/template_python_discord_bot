# Comma separated list of roles. These can be a role's name or the role ID. Using the
#   role ID preferred. To have one role list get the values from another role list add "*" in front
#   of the role list's name who's values you wish to get.
#   IE:
#   admin = some_role,admin_role
#   mod = *admin,other_role
#   ^ is the same as: mod = some_role,admin_role,other_role
